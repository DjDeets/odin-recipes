		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Boiled chicken, the simplest way I know to make good chicken. It's very easy to clean up, as everything is contained in one giant pot.</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a complete recipe, but rather a way to process a bunch of chicken into a source of protein for use in other recipes. It consists of 2 mandatory ingredients.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Chicken</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Optional: Bay leaves</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Add water and salt to taste to a pot, all sized according to the amount of chicken to be prepared. <em>This step comes first because you won't be able to safely taste the water until it's boiling after putting in the chicken.</em> Don't stress, you can add more water and salt <strong>later</strong> after the water is safe to taste.</li>
			<li>Mix water and taste, the water should be salty. This is also a good time to add the Bay leaves (feel free to expriment).</li>
			<li>Carefully add chicken to the seasoned water. And immediately discard packaging, clean all surfaces which the raw chicken comes in contact with.</li>
			<li>Bring the water and chicken to a simmer. <em>Lids are useful for this purpose.</em></li>
			<li>Simmer the heck out of the chicken until it looks fully cooked. Simmer longer if you plan on pulling the chicken into shreds.</li>
			<li>Carefully remove the chicken from the broth.</li>
			<li>Store the chicken broth for use. Can be drank as is, or used in soup or in place of water.</li>
			<li>Pre-process the chicken as you would like. Typically this means to either cut it or shred it.</li>
			<li>Store the chicken for later use.</li>
		</ol>
		<p> You can now use this chicken to easily add protein to meals. Add it to your, salad, your pasta, serve it on rice, etc. You can brown it on a skillet, add seasonings (fancy), or just add bbq sauce to it and enjoy a pulled chicken sandwich. You also have protein infused broth which you can use to make stews, soups, pan sauces, and rice! Get creative!</p>
