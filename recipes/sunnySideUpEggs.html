		<h1>Sunny Side Up Eggs</h1>
		<img src=images/sunnyFriedEgg.jpg width=1024 height=768 alt="A cooked egg lays on a plate. The yolk is visible and the cooked white pools in a circle around the yolk on the plate. The edges of the egg white are slightly brown due to being crisped. Toast is also on the plate, but not the image's focus.">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>My prefered way of preparing fresh eggs. Sadly, if the eggs aren't fresh, the yolk won't cook properly (runny yolk methods get eliminated). Though if that's the case, it's pretty easy to switch to a different method of cooking (flip the egg, or scramble).</p>
		<p>Clean up is much easier than scrambled eggs. The ingredients are basic, however a non-stick pan is still highly recomended. You might be able to get away with a regular pan with a lot of oil.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fresh Eggs (typically purchased less than a week prior)</li>
			<li>Fat (butter, oil, etc)</li>
			<li>Optional: Salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat pan on medium. Water drops should sizzle when the pan is at a good temperature. If using butter, then the perfect temperature is when the butter melts and lightly sizzles on contact.</li>
			<li>Add fat, coat the pan with fat.</li>
			<li>Crack an egg into the pan. Mind the yolks. (They'll exit their membrane if it gets cut on the shell, then there will be no 'sun' on the egg.) I typically place the shell in an empty spot in the pan to make clean up easier.</li>
			<li>Repeat for all eggs you plan on cooking.</li>
			<li>Dispose of shells and wash hands.</li>
			<li>Increase heat to medium-high and add additional fat if needed.</li>
			<li>Wait for egg whites to solidify, eggs should be done if the whites are cooked through and the yolks are warm to touch. If the eggs aren't fresh enough, the yolks will remain cold for an extended period of time (time to switch cooking stratigies).</li>
			<li>Move eggs onto a plate and serve with salt to taste. I typically put a pinch on each yolk.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Enjoy the eggs! Theoretically I speculate that maybe one could cook an egg with no additional fat if one uses low heat and a lot of time with a non-stick pan. Also salt is optional, but you'll probably want to season with something else.</p>
